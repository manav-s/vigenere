### Inspiration

While watching an episode of White Collar (an American police procedural drama television series),
I witnessed one of the characters manually calculating the encryption
for a Vigenere cipher. The strength of the cipher fascinated me, 
and I knew that this could make an excellent demonstration of why 
coding is so important.

### How to
To launch the program, continue to the VigenereCipherView class and 
run the main method.

### Features
The program is capable of encoding and decoding a phrase with
a given key. The password field will ensure the key stays hidden.

### Limitations and Possible Improvements
With this first version, neither the message or key can contain any spaces or non-English characters.
